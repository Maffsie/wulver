Wulver
======

The Wulver is, in Scots mythology, an immortal spirit - similar to a werewolf. Nonviolent unless attacked, the Wulver has been known to show kindness or to help the less fortunate.
Wulver is here to make sure your server is doing what it's supposed to be doing, and to let you know if it's not.
Wulver is a perl-based daemon that runs preconfigured checks, on preconfigured hosts, at preconfigured times, and is built to be extremely extendable and easy to modify.
Wulver is licensed under the BSD 3-clause license.

Requirements:
* Compatible operating system. At this time, Wulver is known to be compatible with FreeBSD 9.0 and Gentoo Linux, and will be directly maintained on both platforms.
* Perl 5, and all necessary modules. A list of necessary modules is not available at this time. You will also need to ensure perl is compiled with threading support.
* More as the project develops.

Installing:
* Install instructions will be provided when Wulver is in a suitable state for use.
